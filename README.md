# Nuts n Bolts

This is a demo project that shows the importance of building web apps with accessibility (a11y) in mind. Each of the tabs includes two variations - an accessibile version and an inaccessible one - available via the toggle botton in the bottom right corner. While both appear the same from a visual perspective, the difference in the underlying structures provide drastically different experiences for users who rely on voice technologies or keyboard shortcuts.
